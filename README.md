#INTRODUCTION
Welcome to our C++ project on Automated Teller Machine (ATM), designed to provide users with a seamless banking experience. Our project aims to simulate the basic functions of an ATM machine with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including account creation, login, cash withdrawals, deposits, fund transfers, balance inquiries, and transaction history.Our project is user-friendly, efficient, and secure, featuring error handling mechanisms and advanced encryption techniques to ensure the safety and privacy of users' personal and financial information. Whether you're a first-time user or a seasoned banker, our ATM project provides a comprehensive and practical solution for managing your finances at your fingertips.

#OBJECTIVE
Our main objective is to speed up the transactions done by customers. No manual transactions needed generally. The second objective is to save the time which is very important now a days. It will
Include:
##To render accurate services to customer.
##The reduction of fraudulent activities.
##To achieve speedy processing of customer data.
##To reduce error processing , the guarantee of increase security.

#PROJECT MODULES
ATM Database System Modules

**User authentication: The first step in any ATM project is to authenticate the user. This can be done using a PIN or other form of identification.
**Account access: Once the user has been authenticated, the ATM should display the account information, such as the account balance and transaction history.
**Cash withdrawals: The user should be able to withdraw cash from their account. The ATM should prompt the user for the amount they wish to withdraw and dispense the appropriate amount of cash.
**Account management: The user should be able to manage their account, such as changing their PIN, updating personal information, or closing their account.

#FUTURE SCOPE
**Advanced Authentication Mechanisms: Implement advanced authentication methods such as biometric authentication (fingerprint, iris scan, etc.) or facial recognition to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.

**Support for Additional Banking Services: Expand the range of banking services offered through the ATM, such as check deposits, loan applications, account opening, and investment management. This expansion can make the ATM a more comprehensive self-service banking solution.

**Integration with Digital Wallets and Contactless Payments: Enable ATM machines to support digital wallets and contactless payment methods, such as NFC or QR code-based payments, to align with the evolving trends in payment technology.

#EXPECTED OUTPUT 
The expected output of our C++ project on Automated Teller Machine (ATM) is a fully functional and user-friendly banking system that simulates the basic functions of an ATM machine. Users can expect to perform the following tasks:

Login to their account using their account number and PIN.
Withdraw cash from their account, with the option to choose from preset denominations or enter a custom amount.
Deposit cash into their account using the cash deposit slot.
Check their account balance and view their transaction history.
Can change their pinÂ conveniently.
